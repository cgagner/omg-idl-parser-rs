# OMG IDL Parser
A pure rust implementation of an OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL) 
version 4.2. For more information, see [OMG IDL 4.2](https://www.omg.org/spec/IDL/4.2/PDF).


***Work in Progress***: This repository is not complete. At the time of 
writing this, the parse can only validate an IDL file.
